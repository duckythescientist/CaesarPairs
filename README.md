Certain words in the English language form other valid words when Caesar Shifted
cubed shifted by 10 becomes melon

This program finds all pairs of length 3+ from a dictionary 
The dictionary is currently hardcoded (but comes standard with most Linux)
"/usr/share/dict/american-english"

This program likely is written poorly. I have moderate coding experience, 
but I am very new to Python. 
I'm open to suggestions and bug fixes. 

Run CaesarPairs.py as a standalone. 
I'll possibly change the method and return type to make it reusable and 
suitable for other tasks. Expect changes. 

Note, pairs of rotation 13 are doubled, and shifts only go up to 13.
Above 13 would yield redundant results.
